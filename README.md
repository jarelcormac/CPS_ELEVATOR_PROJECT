## INTRODUCTION TO CLASS
This project is made for *COMPE596 - Cyber-Physical Systems/CPS* at **San Diego State University** by Jarel-John Macanas and Shoh Sewell. CPS is the combination of cyber capabilites such as computation/communication, and physical capabilities such as sensors. Here we learn about how to formally model CPS's, design and implement control algorithms, and verify the corectness of devised methods.

## INTRODUCTION TO PROJECT
### Description
This class requires that, if possible, designs be implemented with hardware run by student-made firmware. In the case of our project, due to the nature of how big and expensive implementation of designs would be at a real life scale, we are opting instead to fully simulate the functionality of our CPS system, writing primarily in C/C++.
For our project, we aim to create a multi-directional elevator in a 2D-space with 9 evenly-spaced apart nodes. The elevator will be able to move in four cardinal directions - up, down, left, and right. A pathfinding algorithm to control the movement of the elevator will be created such that the elevator will be able to move from each node as efficiently as possible.
If you would like more information on how this elevator is designed, please refer to our [Initial Project Proposal](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zJ5IUaY9PxZ2nMWNdTR4G8eQRFSZgF6o/view?usp=sharing).
